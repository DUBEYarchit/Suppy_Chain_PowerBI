This Power BI dashboard presents a detailed overview of supply chain performance, highlighting crucial metrics such as revenue generation, transportation efficiency, and cost analysis. It offers valuable insights into how different components of the supply chain interconnect and impact overall operational effectiveness.

## Project Summary
The dashboard is organized to showcase vital KPIs such as overall revenue, total costs, number of products sold, and carrier-specific shipping expenses. It further breaks down revenue and cost figures across multiple transportation methods—Road, Rail, Air, and Sea—and evaluates these metrics by different routes. Additionally, it presents revenue performance by product category and explores demographic data, including customer gender, for a more granular analysis.
